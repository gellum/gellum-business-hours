* Disable checkout functionality, preventing orders from being placed.
* Display a customizable notice (using WooCommerce's native system) informing customers that the store is currently closed.
* Inform customers of the next available date and time the store will be open.
* Shortcode that allows you to easily add a store status notice to any page. [gellum_business_hours]

Features:
* Set opening and closing times for each day of the week.
* Time selection in 15-minute intervals using a 24-hour format.
* Enable or disable specific days entirely.
* User-friendly settings page integrated into the WooCommerce menu.
* Automatic detection of store status based on current WordPress timezone settings.
* Clear notifications for customers regarding store status and next opening time.
* HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) compatible.
* Customizable admin interface with "Readex Pro" Google Font for a modern look.
* Shortcode `[gellum_business_hours]` to display current store status on your website's frontend.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the `gellum-business-hours` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Navigate to **WooCommerce > Business Hours** in your WordPress admin panel to configure the settings.

4.  Save changes. The plugin will now manage your store's availability based on your schedule.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin support timezones? =

Yes, Gellum Business Hours uses the timezone configured in your WordPress settings (Settings > General) to accurately determine if your store is open or closed.

= Can I set different hours for different days? =

Yes, you can configure unique opening and closing times for each day of the week (Monday through Sunday), or mark specific days as closed.

= What happens when the store is closed? =

When the store is determined to be closed based on your configured hours:
* WooCommerce notices will inform customers on cart and checkout pages that the store is closed and when it will reopen.
* Checkout buttons will be disabled or hidden, preventing new orders.

= How are overnight hours handled? =

The plugin supports overnight schedules (e.g., opening Monday 10:00 PM and closing Tuesday 2:00 AM). The logic correctly identifies theseè·¨å¤© schedules.

= How can I display the store status on my website? =

You can use the shortcode `[gellum_business_hours]` in any page, post, or widget to display whether your store is currently "Open" or "Closed", along with relevant timing information (like "Closing in XX minutes" or next opening time). The output is styled with CSS classes `.gellum-business-hours-open` and `.gellum-business-hours-closed`.
